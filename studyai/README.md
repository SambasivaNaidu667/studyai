## 📋 Problem Statement

### Who is the user?
**University and high school students** preparing for semester exams, competitive exams, or certification tests who need a structured, intelligent approach to managing their study material across multiple subjects.

### What problem are we solving?
Students overwhelmingly struggle with:
- **Fragmented study planning** — managing dozens of topics across multiple subjects without a centralized system
- **No personalized pacing** — generic study plans ignore individual strengths, weaknesses, and available time
- **Lack of self-assessment** — students don't know what they've mastered vs. what needs revision until the exam
- **Motivation gaps** — without progress visibility and streak tracking, students lose consistency

### Why does this problem matter?
Studies show that **structured study planning** combined with **active recall testing** dramatically improves retention. Yet most students rely on unorganized notes and last-minute cramming. StudyAI solves this by combining **AI-driven personalization** with **real-time progress analytics** to create a study experience that adapts to each student's unique needs.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features
- **📚 Subject & Topic Management** — Full CRUD: Create subjects, add topics with priority levels (High/Medium/Low) and estimated hours, toggle completion, add notes, delete
- **🗓️ AI Study Planner** — Gemini AI generates personalized weekly roadmaps based on exam date, available hours, and topic priorities

- **📊 Analytics Dashboard** — Visual progress tracking with subject breakdowns, priority-based completion stats, and AI-powered weak area detection
- **✨ AI Chat Assistant** — Conversational AI tutor powered by Gemini for answering study questions

### User Experience
- **🔐 Authentication** — Email/password signup & login with Firebase Auth; protected routes prevent unauthorized access
- **🔥 Streak Tracking** — Daily study streak counter that persists across sessions
- **⚡ Navigation Safety** — Unsaved progress warnings when navigating away from active sessions (custom `useNavigationBlocker` hook)
- **🎨 Dark Theme UI** — Purpose-built dark interface with custom design system

## ⚛️ React Concepts Demonstrated



### Core Concepts
| Concept | Where Used |
|---------|------------|
| Functional Components | Every component in the project |
| Props & Composition | `<Card>`, `<Button>`, `<Badge>`, `<StatCard>`, `<TopicItem>` |
| `useState` | Auth forms, state toggles, UI toggles, form inputs |
| `useEffect` | Data loading, profile sync, auth state listener |
| Conditional Rendering | Auth guard, empty states, loading states |
| Lists & Keys | Subject lists, topic lists, schedule items |

### Intermediate Concepts
| Concept | Where Used |
|---------|------------|
| Lifting State Up | Subject data in context |
| Controlled Components | All form inputs (Input, Select, textarea) |
| React Router | `BrowserRouter`, `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`, `<Navigate>` |
| Context API | `AuthContext` (auth state), `AppContext` (global app state) |

### Advanced Concepts
| Concept | Where Used |
|---------|------------|
| `useMemo` | Progress calculations, exam day countdown, pending topics, priority breakdown |
| `useCallback` | All CRUD operations, navigation blocker |
| `useRef` | Navigation blocker location tracking (`useNavigationBlocker` hook) |
| `React.lazy` + `Suspense` | All page components are code-split in `AppLayout.jsx` |
| Performance optimization | Memoized derived state, lazy loading, debounced updates |

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Database

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **BaaS Provider** | Firebase (Auth + Cloud Firestore) |
| **Auth Method** | Email/Password via `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` / `signInWithEmailAndPassword` |
| **Protected Routes** | `<ProtectedRoute>` component wraps all app routes; redirects to `/auth` if unauthenticated |
| **Persistent Data** | Subjects, topics, schedule, and user profile stored in Firestore collections |
| **CRUD Operations** | Full Create, Read, Update, Delete on subjects, topics, schedule items, and user profiles |

### Firestore Collections
```
users/{uid}          → User profile, preferences, streak
subjects/{id}        → Subject data with nested topics array (uid-filtered)
schedule/{id}        → Study session items (uid-filtered)
sessions/{uid_date}  → Study session logs for streak tracking
```
